This is a rust crate for creating and interacting with `quilt` repositories. For
the command line interface to `quilt`, see the `quilt` crate.

The API documentation for this crate is reasonably complete, but high-level
documentation isn't. The best I have so far can be found in this [series of
blog posts](https://jneem.github.io).
